1.) I designed a page for a client who is involved in the sneaker market, they wanted a modern theme thats why I stuck with a white background and black lettering. The pictures were not anything crazy because the pictures also had a white background.

2.) Its important to consider mobile devices because a-lot of people use there mobile devices as a tool and because almost everyone owns a cell phone that can access the internet it is important to consider them because they will make up a big part of your pages online traffic.

3.) This assignment was really fun and it was enjoyable to play around with different genres of the website to see what looks the best. I had trouble correlating the blog page to someone else just because I did make it somewhat personal. I also had troubles structuring some specific items on my home page but other than that this assignment was enjoyable.
